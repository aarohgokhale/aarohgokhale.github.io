      A Review of Org Roam and Org Roam UI

<p>
I have been using the <a href="https://www.orgroam.com/">Org Roam</a> package on emacs on an off for the last semester or so for taking notes for various subjects including compilers, point set (and a little bit of algebraic) topology, abstract algebra, some measure theory, machine learning, and even neuroevolution. Org roam is based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">zettelkasten</a> philosophy of notetaking, which has been explored and talked about by many people on the internet, so I won&#39;t go into that here. Instead, I have gathered some of my thoughts after some use of org roam and I will be writing them here.</p>

The Benefits
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<div id="outline-container-headline-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-2">
Motivation
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-3">
<p>One of the most immediate and apparent benefits of using org roam has almost nothing to do with the methodology of zettelkastens themselves, but more so with the way the <a href="https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui">Org Roam UI</a> package allows org roam users to visualize their graph of org roam nodes. Org roam UI displays all nodes and their connections in a really nice interactive graph with lots of theming and display options. It also comes with a really nice physics engine that allows the user to drag nodes around for cool visual effects. For me, one of the nonobvious benefits of this package has actually been the ability to see my web of notes grow larger and more dense over time. It can really be a source of motivation to write more notes and try to find as many connections between concepts as possible, because connections in concepts directly translate to more densely connected areas in the graph. The drive to find as many connections as possible is then itself very helpful for the retention of information, since each connection forces me to revist an old concept and see how it relates to the new concept I am writing about. The whole system really helps reinforce different topics altogether and allows me to see how things are connected in the big picture. </p>

<h3 id="headline-3">
Connections
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The most obvious point of connection between topics is the <em>set</em>. The set is one of the most primitive objects in modern mathematics and is used in essentially every field of study that uses mathematics to model something. With this, we must realize that connections that go through the set node are nearly meaningless. They don&#39;t really say much about how two concepts are connected. The same is true about <em>functions</em>. What is more interesting is when two areas in the graph such as topology and algebra are connected nontrivially through a node such as the <em>isomorphism</em> node. Isomorphisms are normally defined on <em>groups</em>, <em>rings</em>, and similar algebraic structures, but <em>homemorphisms</em> can themselves be viewed as isomorphisms of <em>topological spaces</em>, since they are structure preserving maps. Perhaps such generalized connections would be more abundant with category theory, when I get to learning it. Of course, there are literal connecting points between algebra and topology too, like the fundamental group.</p>

<h3 id="headline-4">
Typesetting
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-3">
<p>This isn&#39;t really much of a benefit as much as it is an essential feature. If emacs didn&#39;t have in-buffer LaTeX previews or if org roam ui didn&#39;t have the ability to display LaTeX using katex, I would simply have not used these packages. Much of what I take notes on has mathematical notation all over the place, so it is crucial for any notetaking app to be able to display math.</p>

The Drawbacks
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-2">
<div id="outline-container-headline-6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-6">
Poor Conventional Notetaking
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The most apparent drawback with using org roam has been my inability to map conventional notes onto this system in an easy manner. The thing with educational content, be it in lecture form or textbook form, is that it hardly lends itself to be sorted into nice chunks separated by specific concepts. I have often experienced attending a lecture or reading a textbook where an entire section is dedicated to the development of multiple intertwining ideas altogether, and this really doesn&#39;t work well with the structure of dividing things up into individual concepts that are then connected with links. Perhaps this actually isn&#39;t as much of a downside as I think it is. There does seem to be some merit to the idea that if I am forced to convert standard expository material into this format, I am much more likely to absorb it. I would need to know how to split up a section into different org roam nodes, which would then force me to truly understand what is going on and how the different concepts are related. Another thing that I haven&#39;t actually explored is the daily note functionality, which might actually be better suited for first writing down whatever is coming at my way from textbooks or lectures. I could then sift through the lecture notes and properly organize them into final org roam nodes. This would perhaps actually help my retention and understanding of the topic by forcing me to revist everything that I write down. </p>
<p>
Coming back to the point, org roam doesn&#39;t map as easily to conventional notetaking as regular org mode does, and requires some additional conversion work. Perhaps that is a good thing in the long run if one can stick to it.</p>

<h3 id="headline-7">
LaTeX Notetaking is Suboptimal in General
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Another thing to note is that LaTeX notetaking, and probably any typesetting based notetaking in general, is quite suboptimal in terms of ease of use when compared to good old pen and paper. I find that mathematical concepts flow quite a bit more smoothly when I am using pen and paper. There is much less friction when converting an abstract idea in my head to symbolic notation on paper. There is an obvious tradeoff here: we are trading ease of use for ease of access (due to search and hyperlinks) and easier preservation (making a backup is trivial compared to pen and paper).</p>

Final Thoughts
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-2">
<p>This experiment of using org roam has been fairly succesful and helped me take more notes this semester than any semester that came before. By rewarding me for taking notes and making connections, org roam has made studying and reviewing a lot more fun than it used to be. I have seen what some other people&#39;s UI graphs look like, and mine completely pales in comparison. I hope to have a respectable graph by the end of the Spring 2025 semester.</p>
