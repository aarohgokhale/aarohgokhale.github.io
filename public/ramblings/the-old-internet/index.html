I wanted to see other people's opinions on Code Geass, and I stumbled upon a seemingly ancient blog that chronicled the release of every new episode of CG while it was airing. Something about the blog really pulled me in. I read some other posts on that blog from that era—mostly about releases of new techonology—and it transported me to a bygone era of the internet.\nThe internet that I grew up on (I mainly started using the internet extensively around 2013 onward) was quite a bit different from the internet that came just a few years before that. The rapidly changing nature of the web meant that by the time I got truly using the internet on an everyday basis, much of its original charm was gone. I'm talking blogs, forums, IRC. Sure these things might exist to some extent today, but the landscape of today's internet looks vastly different. It seems that the functionality of blogs and forums has now been replaced by things such as Twitter, Reddit, and Youtube. The almost complete centralization of expression (there are exceptions) has, as it seems to me, made the internet lose the charm that it once had. When I visit old forums, I see that people were genuinely engaging with each other, talking sincerely about their interests. On Reddit, there are a hundred bots on every post. Everything is moderated to death, and barely anything seems genuine. It really doesn't feel like there are real people on the other side of the screen writing the things that are written on Reddit. Some of the smaller subreddits manage to replicate the feeling of old forums to some extent, but it's just not the same. I can't quite place my finger on it. Maybe I am just romanticizing an era that I wasn't a part of, much the same way people like to think fondly of the past with a distorted lens.\nWhenever I find a blog that has been in writing for a very long time, I always find it really fun and interesting to go all the way back to the very first post. A couple of blogs that come to mind are from professors, such as the Shtetl-Optimized blog by Dr. Scott Aaronson, or the n-Category Café by several professors from different universities. Visiting the posts from the early days of these blogs gives me a glimpse into the past. It really feels like a completely different internet from what we have now. People don't interact like that on the internet nowadays. There's some excitement and a feeling of freshness to those posts. Now that online social conventions have matured and become commonplace, we don't get to see comments like that. It seems like the more the internet has become governed by algorithms and attention maximization, the less it is a place of novel curiosity and intrigue. It may seem like a cliché, but it does seem like the internet is a less fun place to just \"hang out\" in these days. Given how many applications are doing everything in their power to suck us into a cycle of infinite scrolling, it seems like messaging people and finding relevant information will soon be just a few of the remaining things worth doing on the internet.\nIn the past few months, I was reading the entirety of the dragon ball manga, and I frequently found myself asking random questions about plot points and power scaling, like a typical dragon ball fan. I kept finding myself returning to a website called Kazenshuu, where I frequently found very old posts about the exact issues and questions I had with and about the manga. It seemed like a really cool place for \"real\" dragon ball fans to hang out and talk. It seemed to have a lot more passion and enthusiasm about the series than the equivalent Reddit communities. It seemed like something that should exist for every hobby. Of course, I have visited my fair share of forums for things like Gentoo and Arch linux, and things like GameFAQs, but it really seems like something that could be much more commonplace for all sorts of hobbies. Now, I could just be ignorant, and these places probably do exist, but I do think that things like Reddit take away from the popularity of forums. I would really like to see a widespread resurgence in the popularity of individual forums for different fandoms and hobbies, and a move away from centralized platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Given how Reddit has shown its true colors over the last few years, it would probably be the best for everybody if forums became popular again.\nAll in all, what I would really love to see a resurgence of is a personal internet, where more people have their own websites and more people put out their own content rather than just consuming things that are being shoved in their faces. Of course, this is incredibly unlikely given the direction that we seem to be headed in, but one can hope…\n",

One of the reasons I decided to start writing a blog this year was because I was inspired by an old blog I found while watching Code Geass all the way back in December last year. I wanted to see other people&#39;s opinions on Code Geass, and I stumbled upon a seemingly <em>ancient</em> blog that chronicled the release of every new episode of CG while it was <em>airing</em>. Something about the blog really pulled me in. I read some other posts on that blog from that era—mostly about releases of new techonology—and it transported me to a bygone era of the internet.</p>
